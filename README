# Graph explorer #

Given:
* a generated list of all metrics available in your graphite system
* a bunch of small template files which define which graphs can be generated based on which available metrics you have

it generates a list of graphs with simple names.  on the webpage you can then type a pattern which is matched against all possible graphs,
and all the matching ones are shown.

## Dependencies ##
